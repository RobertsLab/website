### Postdoctoral Researchers
We are always open to collaborating with potential postdocs who are interested in submitting applications for personal fellowships. We have had postdocs work on a wide range of projects in our group, both continuing work that has been ongoing in our lab for some time and taking on entirely new (for us) research directions. We value diversity of experience and scientific training, and are always looking to grow!

Please email sr320@uw.edu with your CV and research interests (can be in the form of a cover letter) to discuss potential opportunities.
