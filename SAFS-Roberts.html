Research in our lab focuses on characterizing physiological responses of marine organisms to environmental change. Using integrative approaches we strive to examine impacts and adaptive potential from the nucleotide to organismal level. A core component of this includes investigating the functional relationship of genetics, epigenetics, and transcription. At the molecular level, we are examining the role of DNA methylation in organismal physiology and the potential of the process to impact resilience and evolution. Several of our ongoing projects focus on the native and rare Olympia oyster, considering the potential effects that mixing wild and aquaculture stocks might have on the species’ overall health. We are also tackling the problem of larval mortality that has lately plagued shellfish growers throughout Washington state, considering the role that ocean acidification, emerging diseases, and xenobiotics might play.
